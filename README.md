modules:
  - module: "synapse_invite_checker.InviteChecker"
    config:
        title: "TIM Contact API by Famedly", # Title for the info endpoint, optional
        description: "Custom description for the endpoint", # Description for the info endpoint, optional
        contact: "random@example.com", # Contact information for the info endpoint, optional
        federation_list_url: "https://localhost:8080", # Full url where to fetch the federation list from, required
        federation_list_client_cert: "tests/certs/client.pem", # path to a pem encoded client certificate for mtls, required if federation list url is https
        gematik_ca_baseurl: "https://download-ref.tsl.ti-dienste.de/", # the baseurl to the ca to use for the federation list, required
        tim-type: "epa" or "pro", # Patient/Insurance or Professional mode, defaults to "pro" mode. Optional currently, but will be required in a later release
        defaultPermissions: # see 'defaultPermissions' below. The server defaults for new users or existing users with no permissions already set. Other than the noted default for 'defaultSetting', no other defaults are established
          defaultSetting: "allow all" or "block all" # Default "allow all"
          serverExceptions:
            "<server_name>": # The server names to include. Note the ':' on the end and that double quotes are needed around server names
            "@LOCAL_SERVER@": # A special option to template the local server into without having to know its name. Note that the double quotes are required for this special case.
          userExceptions:
            "<mxid>": # Any users that should be an exception to the 'defaultSetting'.
            "@user:some_server.com": # An example. Note the ':' on the end and that double quotes are needed around user names
          groupException:
          - groupName: "isInsuredPerson" # For the moment, the only option. Note the double quotes and the hyphen at the start of the line
        allowed_room_versions: # The list(as strings) of allowed room versions. Currently optional, defaults are listed
          - "9"
          - "10"
        room_scan_run_interval: see 'Duration Parsing' below, # How often to scan for rooms that are eligible for deletion. Defaults to "1h". Setting to "0" completely disables all room scanning
        insured_only_room_scan:
          enabled: true or false  # optional switch to disable the insured-only room scan from running.  The scan is enabled by default, but only runs in EPA mode, otherwise this option is ignored and the scan is disabled.
          grace_period: see 'Duration Parsing' below, # Length of time a room with only EPA members is allowed to exist before deletion. Ignored if `enabled` is false. Defaults to "1w"
        inactive_room_scan:
          enabled: true or false # optional switch to disable the room scan for inactive rooms, defaults to true
          grace_period: see 'Duration Parsing' below # Length of time a room is allowed to have no message activity before it is eligible for deletion. Ignored if 'enabled' is false. Defaults to "26w" which is 6 months
        override_public_room_federation: true or false, # Forces the `m.federate` flag to be set to False when creating a public room to prevent it from federating. Default is "true", disable with "false"
        prohibit_world_readable_rooms: true or false, # Prevent setting any rooms history visibility as 'world_readable'. Defaults to "true"
        block_invites_into_dms: true or false, # Prevent invites into existing DM chats. Defaults to true
```
### defaultPermissions

For establishing the default permissions for the users on this server. As the simplest
example:
```yaml
defaultPermissions:
  defaultSetting: "allow all"
```
This is what the default will be if no setting is entered for this section.

an example to allow all communication except for insured users
```yaml
defaultPermissions:
  defaultSetting: "allow all"
  groupException:
    - groupName: "isInsuredPerson"
```
and an example of blocking all communication except for users on the local server
```yaml
defaultPermissions:
  defaultSetting: "block all"
  serverExceptions:
    "@LOCAL_SERVER@":
```

### Duration Parsing

Settings labeled as 'duration_parsing' allow for a string representation of the value
that is converted to milliseconds. Suffixes with 's', 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w', or 'y' may be used. For example:
`1h` would translate to `3600000` milliseconds

## Testing

The tests uses twisted's testing framework trial, with the development
enviroment managed by hatch. Running the tests and generating a coverage report
can be done like this:

```console
hatch run cov
```
